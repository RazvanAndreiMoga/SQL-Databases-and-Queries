# SQL-Databases-and-Queries
Two SQL databases I worked on during the 3rd semester.

## Train Transport Company
This contains the database of such a company, along with trains, routes, stations, customers and tickets.

## Events Organiser 
This is a database used for organising events on different continents and countries with different participants
